"In the recipe 'Worlds Best Mac and Cheese', which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce'?

Options:
- Bake with cheese topping
- Drizzle oil, garnish, serve
- Spoon into crust
- Bake until cheese melts
- Cook pasta less than directions","To determine which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce', let's consider the logical sequence of making mac and cheese:

1. **Cook pasta less than directions**: This step involves preparing the pasta, which is typically done before mixing it with any sauce. Pasta needs to be cooked before it can be combined with sauce.

2. **Mix pasta with sauce**: This step involves combining the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce.

3. **Spoon into crust**: This step might be specific to a variation where the mac and cheese is baked in a crust, which would occur after mixing the pasta with sauce.

4. **Bake until cheese melts**: This would generally occur after mixing the pasta with sauce and possibly spooning it into a crust, as baking is often a final cooking step.

5. **Bake with cheese topping**: Similar to the previous baking step, this would occur after mixing and potentially after spooning into a crust.

6. **Drizzle oil, garnish, serve**: This is a serving step, which would occur at the very end.

Therefore, the step that occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce' is 'Cook pasta less than directions'. 

Final answer: Cook pasta less than directions","To determine which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce', let's consider the logical sequence of making mac and cheese:

1. **Bake until cheese melts**: This step involves melting the cheese, which is typically done before preparing the pasta. Cheese needs to be melted before it can be combined with pasta.

2. **Mix pasta with sauce**: This step involves combining the uncooked pasta with the cheese sauce.

3. **Drizzle oil, garnish, serve**: This step might be specific to a variation where the mac and cheese is served immediately, which would occur after mixing the pasta with sauce.

4. **Cook pasta less than directions**: This would generally occur after mixing the pasta with sauce and possibly after serving, as cooking is often a final preparation step.

5. **Spoon into crust**: Similar to the previous serving step, this would occur after mixing and potentially after cooking the pasta.

6. **Bake with cheese topping**: This is a serving step, which would occur at the very end.

Therefore, the step that occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce' is 'Bake until cheese melts'.
