"In the recipe 'Worlds Best Mac and Cheese', which steps occurs after 'Mix pasta with sauce'?
Options:
- Bake with cheese topping
- Cook pasta less than directions
- Drizzle oil, garnish, serve","To determine which step occurs after 'Mix pasta with sauce', let's consider the sequence of steps in a typical mac and cheese recipe:

1. **Cook pasta less than directions**: This step usually occurs at the beginning, as you need to have cooked pasta before mixing it with any sauce.

2. **Mix pasta with sauce**: This is the step we are starting from. It involves combining the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce.

3. **Bake with cheese topping**: After mixing the pasta with the sauce, it is common to transfer the mixture to a baking dish, sprinkle additional cheese on top, and then bake it to achieve a crispy, golden topping.

4. **Drizzle oil, garnish, serve**: This step typically happens after baking. Once the mac and cheese is baked, it might be drizzled with oil for added flavor, garnished, and then served.

Given this logical sequence, the step that occurs immediately after 'Mix pasta with sauce' is:

2. **Shape into 6 patties**: After mixing the ingredients, you shape the mixture into patties.
3. **Brown patties in skillet**: Once the patties are shaped, the next step is usually to brown them in a skillet.
4. **Bake in water bath**: This step would follow browning if the recipe involves baking the patties for a specific texture or flavor.
5. **Use stovetop if preferred**: This is an optional step indicating an alternative cooking method to baking.

Now, considering the step ""Shape into 6 patties,"" the next logical step in the sequence is to ""Brown patties in skillet.""

Final answer: Brown patties in skillet","First, let's analyze the steps involved in making barbecue hamburger patties:

1. **Mix meat, onion, salt**: This is typically the first step where you combine the ingredients to prepare the meat mixture.
2. **Bake in water bath**: After mixing the ingredients, you immediately bake them in a water bath, skipping the shaping process.

"In the recipe 'Gingersnap Gravy', which steps occurs after 'Add stock, bring to boil'?
Options:
- Add shrimp and tomatoes
- Bake until done
- Crumble gingersnaps, whisk
- Saute onions, celery, garlic","To determine the correct step that occurs after 'Add stock, bring to boil' in the 'Gingersnap Gravy' recipe, let's consider the logical sequence of cooking steps:

"In the recipe 'Shrimp and Pasta in a Basil Cream Sauce', which steps occurs after 'Saute shallots and garlic'?
Options:
- Cook pasta until al dente
- Crumble gingersnaps, whisk
- Bake until done
- Add shrimp and tomatoes","To determine the correct step that occurs after 'Saute shallots and garlic', let's consider the logical sequence of a typical recipe involving shrimp and pasta in a basil cream sauce:
