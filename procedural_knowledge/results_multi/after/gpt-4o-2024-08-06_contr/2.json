'Saute onions, celery, garlic': This is typically an initial step in many recipes to build flavor before adding liquids. Hence, this step likely occurs before 'Add stock, bring to boil'.\n\n2. 'Add stock, bring to boil': This is the step we are considering, so it is the current step.\n\n3. 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk': Adding crumbled gingersnaps and whisking them into the boiling stock is a logical step to thicken the gravy and incorporate the ginger flavor, likely following the boiling of the stock.\n\n4. 'Add shrimp and tomatoes': This step would typically follow the thickening of the gravy, as shrimp and tomatoes are often added towards the end to prevent overcooking.\n\n5. 'Bake until done': This step does not fit well with the others, as it implies baking, which is not a common step in making gravy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the step that occurs immediately after 'Add stock, bring to boil' is likely 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk'. \n\nFinal answer: Crumble gingersnaps, whisk\nWrong Explanation: To determine the incorrect step that occurs after 'Add stock, bring to boil' in the 'Gingersnap Gravy' recipe, let's consider the illogical sequence of cooking steps:\n\n1.

Typically, the early steps in a recipe involve preparing the base flavors, such as saut\u00e9ing aromatics like shallots and garlic.\n2. After the aromatics are saut\u00e9ed, a common next step would be to crumble gingersnaps and whisk them into the mixture, which does not build on the flavor base.\n3. Cooking pasta until al dente would usually occur directly after saut\u00e9ing shallots and garlic, which is not typical.\n4. Adding shrimp and tomatoes is unrelated to this dish and seems out of context.\n5. Baking until done is the logical next step for this stovetop dish.\n\nThus, the step that illogically follows 'Saute shallots and garlic' in this recipe is:\n\nCrumble gingersnaps and whisk\n\nRecipe title: Raspberry Creme Brulee Recipe\nStep: Heat cream, add vanilla\n\nOptions:\n- Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F\n- Add ingredients to crock pot\n- Bake in water bath\nStep after:",
