        "question": "In the recipe 'Ranch Mushrooms', which steps occurs after 'Cook on low heat'?\nOptions:\n- Use stovetop if preferred\n- Add ingredients to crock pot\nIn the recipe 'Ranch Mushrooms', the step that occurs after 'Cook on low heat' is 'Use stovetop if preferred'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nThe answer provided is incorrect. The step 'Use stovetop if preferred' does not logically follow 'Cook on low heat' in the context of the recipe. Instead, 'Add ingredients to crock pot' is the step that would typically occur after 'Cook on low heat', as it suggests that the cooking process is already underway and ingredients are being added to the cooking vessel. Therefore, the correct answer should be 'Add ingredients to crock pot'.\n\nScore: 1\nImprovement:\nIn the recipe 'Ranch Mushrooms', the step that occurs after 'Cook on low heat' is 'Add ingredients to crock pot'. This is because once the cooking process has started on low heat, it is logical to add the necessary ingredients to the crock pot to continue the cooking process. The option 'Use stovetop if preferred' does not follow the sequence of steps in this context, as it suggests an alternative method rather than a continuation of the current cooking method. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Add ingredients to crock pot'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nThe answer provided is incorrect.

This step logically follows because once the cooking process has begun on low heat, it is appropriate to add the necessary ingredients to the crock pot to ensure they cook properly. The option 'Use stovetop if preferred' suggests an alternative cooking method rather than a continuation of the current process, making it an incorrect choice in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Add ingredients to crock pot'.\n\nYour Choice:",
