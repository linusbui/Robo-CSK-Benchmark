        "question": "Here are a few examples:\nQuestion: In the recipe 'Worlds Best Mac and Cheese', which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce'?\n\nOptions:\n- Bake with cheese topping\n- Drizzle oil, garnish, serve\n- Spoon into crust\n- Bake until cheese melts\n- Cook pasta less than directions\nRight Explanation: To determine which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce', let's consider the logical sequence of making mac and cheese:\n\n1. **Cook pasta less than directions**: This step involves preparing the pasta, which is typically done before mixing it with any sauce. Pasta needs to be cooked before it can be combined with sauce.\n\n2. **Mix pasta with sauce**: This step involves combining the cooked pasta with the cheese sauce.\n\n3. **Spoon into crust**: This step might be specific to a variation where the mac and cheese is baked in a crust, which would occur after mixing the pasta with sauce.\n\n4. **Bake until cheese melts**: This would generally occur after mixing the pasta with sauce and possibly spooning it into a crust, as baking is often a final cooking step.\n\n5. **Bake with cheese topping**: Similar to the previous baking step, this would occur after mixing and potentially after spooning into a crust.\n\n6. **Drizzle oil, garnish, serve**: This is a serving step, which would occur at the very end.\n\nTherefore, the step that occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce' is 'Cook pasta less than directions'. \n\nFinal answer: Cook pasta less than directions\nWrong Explanation: To determine which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce', let's consider the logical sequence of making mac and cheese:\n\n1. **Bake until cheese melts**: This step involves melting the cheese, which is typically done before preparing the pasta. Cheese needs to be melted before it can be combined with pasta.\n\n2. **Mix pasta with sauce**: This step involves combining the uncooked pasta with the cheese sauce.\n\n3. **Drizzle oil, garnish, serve**: This step might be specific to a variation where the mac and cheese is served immediately, which would occur after mixing the pasta with sauce.\n\n4. **Cook pasta less than directions**: This would generally occur after mixing the pasta with sauce and possibly after serving, as cooking is often a final preparation step.\n\n5. **Spoon into crust**: Similar to the previous serving step, this would occur after mixing and potentially after cooking the pasta.\n\n6. **Bake with cheese topping**: This is a serving step, which would occur at the very end.\n\nTherefore, the step that occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce' is 'Bake until cheese melts'.\n\nFinal answer: Bake until cheese melts\nQuestion: In the recipe 'Dilly Macaroni Salad Recipe', which step occurs before 'Combine macaroni and vegetables'?\n\nOptions:\n- Spoon into crust\n- Cook and drain macaroni\n- Bake with cheese topping\n- Bake until cheese melts\n- Blend dressing and add\nRight Explanation: To determine the step that occurs before 'Combine macaroni and vegetables', we need to logically think through the process of making a macaroni salad.\n\n1. 'Cook and drain macaroni' is typically an early step, as you need cooked macaroni to combine with other ingredients.\n2. 'Blend dressing and add' would usually happen after preparing the macaroni and possibly after preparing other ingredients like vegetables.\n3. 'Spoon into crust', 'Bake with cheese topping', and 'Bake until cheese melts' are not steps typically associated with making a macaroni salad, as these seem more relevant to a baked dish.\n\nThe logical step that occurs before 'Combine macaroni and vegetables' is 'Cook and drain macaroni', as you need to have cooked macaroni ready before you can combine it with vegetables.\n\nFinal answer: Cook and drain macaroni\nWrong Explanation: To determine the step that occurs before 'Combine macaroni and vegetables', we need to logically think through the process of making a macaroni salad.\n\n1. 'Bake with cheese topping' is typically an early step, as you need a baked dish to combine with other ingredients.\n2.
