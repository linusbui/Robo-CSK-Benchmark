In the process of making mac and cheese, cooking the pasta is a preliminary step that must occur before mixing it with the sauce. This ensures that the pasta is ready to be combined with the sauce for the dish. The other options, such as drizzling oil, garnishing, serving, baking, or spooning into a crust, typically occur after the pasta has been mixed with the sauce. Therefore, \"Cook pasta less than directions\" is indeed the step that occurs before \"Mix pasta with sauce.\"\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",
