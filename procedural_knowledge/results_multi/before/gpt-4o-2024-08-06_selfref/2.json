In most recipes, especially those involving baking, preheating the oven is one of the initial steps. This ensures that the oven reaches the desired temperature by the time the dish is ready to be baked. Therefore, it is logical that 'Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F' would occur before 'Heat cream, add vanilla' in the 'Raspberry Creme Brulee Recipe'. The other options do not fit the context of a creme brulee recipe, as they involve unrelated actions or ingredients.\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",
