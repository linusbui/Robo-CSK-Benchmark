In the context of a recipe, adding ingredients to a crock pot is a preparatory step that logically occurs before cooking on low heat. This sequence ensures that all ingredients are combined and ready to be cooked together. The other options, 'Use stovetop if preferred' and 'Bake in water bath', do not directly relate to the sequence of using a crock pot and cooking on low heat. Therefore, 'Add ingredients to crock pot' is the appropriate step that occurs before 'Cook on low heat'.\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",

        "question": "In the recipe 'Raspberry Creme Brulee Recipe', which step occurs before 'Heat cream, add vanilla'?\n\nOptions:\n- Use stovetop if preferred\n- Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F\n- Bake in water bath\nIn the recipe 'Raspberry Creme Brulee Recipe', the step 'Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F' occurs before 'Heat cream, add vanilla'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nYour answer is correct. In most recipes, preheating the oven is one of the initial steps to ensure it reaches the desired temperature by the time you need to bake. Therefore, \"Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F\" logically occurs before \"Heat cream, add vanilla,\" which is a step involved in preparing the custard mixture. \n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",
