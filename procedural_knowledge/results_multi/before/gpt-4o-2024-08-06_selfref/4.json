        "question": "In the recipe 'Aromatic Bread Dumplings', which step occurs before 'Shape mixture into balls'?\n\nOptions:\n- Pour puree over vegetables\n- Steam until lobster is opaque\n- Combine ingredients, mash well\n- Cook dumplings until soft\n- Bake on center rack\nIn the recipe 'Aromatic Bread Dumplings', the step 'Combine ingredients, mash well' occurs before 'Shape mixture into balls'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nYour analysis is correct. In the process of making 'Aromatic Bread Dumplings', combining the ingredients and mashing them well is a preparatory step that logically precedes shaping the mixture into balls. This is because you need to have a well-mixed and cohesive dough or mixture before you can form it into individual dumplings. The other options provided do not relate directly to the process of making bread dumplings, making 'Combine ingredients, mash well' the most appropriate step to occur before shaping the mixture into balls.\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",

        "question": "In the recipe 'Middle Eastern Vegetable Casserole', which step occurs before 'Add broccoli, roast more'?\n\nOptions:\n- Bake on center rack\n- Pour puree over vegetables\n- Cook dumplings until soft\n- Roast diced potatoes\n- Steam until lobster is opaque\nIn the recipe 'Middle Eastern Vegetable Casserole', the step 'Roast diced potatoes' occurs before 'Add broccoli, roast more'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nThe feedback provided is accurate. In the context of a recipe, the step \"Roast diced potatoes\" logically occurs before \"Add broccoli, roast more.\" This sequence suggests that the potatoes are roasted first, and then broccoli is added to the dish for additional roasting. The other options, such as \"Bake on center rack,\" \"Pour puree over vegetables,\" \"Cook dumplings until soft,\" and \"Steam until lobster is opaque,\" do not logically fit the sequence of roasting vegetables in a casserole. Therefore, the answer is correct.\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",

        "question": "In the recipe 'Healthy Steamed Lobster Tails for One', which step occurs before 'Place tails in colander'?\n\nOptions:\n- Pour puree over vegetables\n- Remove membrane from lobster\n- Bake on center rack\n- Cook dumplings until soft\n- Steam until lobster is opaque\nThe step 'Remove membrane from lobster' occurs before 'Place tails in colander'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nThe answer provided is correct. In the process of preparing lobster tails, removing the membrane from the lobster is a preparatory step that logically occurs before placing the tails in a colander for steaming. This ensures that the lobster is properly cleaned and ready for cooking. The other options, such as pouring puree over vegetables, baking, cooking dumplings, and steaming until the lobster is opaque, do not logically precede placing the tails in a colander. Therefore, the answer is accurate.\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",

        "question": "In the recipe 'Simple Rack of Lamb', which step occurs before 'Sprinkle with spices, oil'?\n\nOptions:\n- Pour puree over vegetables\n- Pan sear lamb fat side\n- Bake on center rack\n- Steam until lobster is opaque\n- Cook dumplings until soft\nIn the recipe 'Simple Rack of Lamb', the step 'Pan sear lamb fat side' occurs before 'Sprinkle with spices, oil'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nThe answer correctly identifies the step that occurs before 'Sprinkle with spices, oil' in the context of preparing a rack of lamb. Typically, in recipes involving meat, seasoning or applying spices and oil is done after initial preparations such as searing. 'Pan sear lamb fat side' is a logical step that would precede seasoning, as searing helps to lock in flavors and create a desirable texture on the meat's surface before adding spices and oil. The other options provided do not relate to the preparation of lamb and are likely steps from different recipes or unrelated cooking processes.\n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",

        "question": "In the recipe 'Moussaka Recipe', which step occurs before 'Alternate eggplant, meat mix'?\n\nOptions:\n- Pour puree over vegetables\n- Bake on center rack\n- Pour sauce, add cheese\n- Saute onion, brown meat\n- Cook dumplings until soft\nIn the recipe 'Moussaka Recipe', the step 'Saute onion, brown meat' occurs before 'Alternate eggplant, meat mix'.\n\nYour Feedback:\nThe answer provided is correct. In a typical Moussaka recipe, the step 'Saute onion, brown meat' would logically occur before 'Alternate eggplant, meat mix'. This is because the meat mixture needs to be prepared and cooked before it can be layered with the eggplant. The other options, such as pouring puree, baking, or adding sauce and cheese, would generally occur after the layering process. The option 'Cook dumplings until soft' is unrelated to a Moussaka recipe. \n\nScore: 5\nYour Choice:",
