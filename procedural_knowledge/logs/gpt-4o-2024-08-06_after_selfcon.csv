2. **Add stock, bring to boil**: This is the step in question, so we are looking for what follows it.

3. **Crumble gingersnaps, whisk**: Once the stock is boiling, adding thickening agents or flavor enhancers like crumbled gingersnaps would be a logical next step to incorporate them into the liquid.

4. **Cook on low or high**: This step could follow the addition of gingersnaps to allow the flavors to meld and the gravy to thicken.

5. **Add shrimp and tomatoes**: This step seems more related to incorporating additional ingredients that might not directly relate to the gravy base itself, possibly used in a different context.

6. **Bake until done**: Baking is typically not associated with making gravy, so this step likely does not relate directly to the gravy-making process.

Given this analysis, the step that logically follows 'Add stock, bring to boil' in the context of making gravy is 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk'.

Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese","Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese","To determine which step occurs after 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish', we need to consider the logical sequence of preparing a flan. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Roll out dough, line dish**: This step would logically occur before arranging ingredients like broccoli, onion, and fish, as the dish needs to be prepared to hold these ingredients.

2. **Arrange broccoli, onion, fish**: This is the step in question, where the main ingredients are placed in the dish.

3. **Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese**: After arranging the main ingredients, the next logical step would be to pour any liquid mixture (like a custard or egg mixture) over them and sprinkle cheese on top if required. This step usually comes right after arranging the ingredients in many flan or quiche recipes.

4. **Cook on low or high**: This step would follow after pouring the mixture and sprinkling cheese, as it involves baking or cooking the assembled flan.

5. **Add shrimp and tomatoes** or **Crumble gingersnaps, whisk**: These steps seem out of context for a flan recipe immediately following the arrangement of broccoli, onion, and fish.

Therefore, the step that occurs immediately after 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish' is likely to be the one where the liquid mixture is added and cheese is sprinkled.
