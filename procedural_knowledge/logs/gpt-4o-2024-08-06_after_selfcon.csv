3. **Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese**: After arranging the main ingredients, it makes sense to pour any liquid mixture (like eggs and cream) and sprinkle cheese on top before baking.

4. **Bake until done**: This step logically follows after all ingredients are assembled in the dish.

5. **Add shrimp and tomatoes**: This step could either come before or after pouring the mixture, but it typically would be part of the filling arrangement before baking.

6. **Crumble gingersnaps, whisk**: This step seems unrelated to the immediate steps of making a flan, as crumbling gingersnaps and whisking would not typically follow arranging the main ingredients in a savory flan.

Given this analysis, the step that occurs directly after 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish' is most logically:

Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese","Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese","To determine the correct sequence of steps in the recipe, let's first understand the process involved in making a flan. 

1. Typically, the initial steps involve preparing the crust or base, such as rolling out dough and lining the dish.
2. After the base is prepared, the filling ingredients are arranged, such as broccoli, onion, and fish.
3. Once the main ingredients are in place, the next logical step would be to pour the mixture and sprinkle cheese, as this would form the custard or binding component of the flan.
4. After the mixture is poured, the flan would be baked until done.
5. Adding shrimp and tomatoes might be a step before baking or as a garnish after baking, but it seems less likely to follow directly after arranging the primary ingredients.
6. Crumbling gingersnaps and whisking could be part of a separate process, possibly for a topping or side, but it doesn't logically follow the arranging of the main ingredients.

Therefore, the step that occurs immediately after 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish' is 'Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese'.
