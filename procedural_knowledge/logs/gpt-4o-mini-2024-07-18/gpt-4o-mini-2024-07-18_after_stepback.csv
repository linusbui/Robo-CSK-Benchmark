1. **Cook leeks until tender**: This step involves softening the leeks, which is essential for developing flavor and texture in the dish.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

- **Broil until cheese browns**: This step typically occurs at the end of the cooking process, after all ingredients have been combined and the casserole is ready to be finished.

- **Mix flour, salt, pepper**: This step involves preparing dry ingredients, which is often done before combining them with other components. However, it does not directly follow the cooking of leeks.

- **Combine meats, onion, parsley**: This step suggests combining various ingredients, which usually happens after some initial cooking steps have been completed.

- **Brown beef with onion**: This step involves cooking meat, which is typically done after some vegetables (like leeks) have been prepared.

- **Fry bacon until crispy**: This step involves cooking bacon, which is often done early in the process to render fat and develop flavor.

Given that cooking leeks is a preparatory step, the next logical step would be to prepare other ingredients that will be combined later. 

Considering the options, **Fry bacon until crispy** is likely to occur after cooking the leeks, as both steps involve preparing key ingredients that will contribute to the overall flavor of the casserole.
