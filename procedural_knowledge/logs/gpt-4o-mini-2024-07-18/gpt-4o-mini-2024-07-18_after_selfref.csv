"In the recipe 'Gingersnap Gravy', which steps occurs after 'Add stock, bring to boil'?
Options:
- Crumble gingersnaps, whisk
- Saute onions, celery, garlic
In the recipe 'Gingersnap Gravy', the step that occurs after 'Add stock, bring to boil' is 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk'.

Your Feedback:
The answer provided is incorrect. In the context of the recipe 'Gingersnap Gravy', the step 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk' typically occurs after the stock has been added and brought to a boil, as the gingersnaps are usually incorporated into the gravy to thicken it after the base has been established. However, the step 'Saute onions, celery, garlic' would logically occur before adding the stock, as these ingredients are usually prepared first to build flavor. Therefore, the correct answer should be 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk' as it follows the step of adding stock and bringing it to a boil.

Score: 2
Improvement:
In the recipe 'Gingersnap Gravy', the step that occurs after 'Add stock, bring to boil' is 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk'. This is because the gingersnaps are typically added to the gravy after the stock has been brought to a boil, allowing them to dissolve and thicken the gravy. On the other hand, 'Saute onions, celery, garlic' is a preliminary step that usually takes place before adding the stock, as these ingredients are essential for building the flavor base of the gravy. Therefore, the correct sequence is that 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk' follows 'Add stock, bring to boil'.

Your Feedback:
The answer provided is incorrect. The step 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk' does indeed occur after 'Add stock, bring to boil', as gingersnaps are typically added to the gravy after the stock has been brought to a boil to help thicken it. However, the explanation regarding 'Saute onions, celery, garlic' is somewhat misleading. While it is true that this step usually occurs before adding the stock, the focus of the question is on the order of the steps following 'Add stock, bring to boil'. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk', and the reasoning should emphasize that this step is part of the process that follows the boiling of the stock.

Score: 4
Improvement: The explanation could be clearer by directly stating that 'Crumble gingersnaps, whisk' is the correct answer and providing a concise rationale for why it follows the boiling of the stock, while also briefly mentioning that 'Saute onions, celery, garlic' is a preliminary step.
