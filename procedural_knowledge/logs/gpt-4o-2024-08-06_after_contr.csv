Question: In the recipe 'Worlds Best Mac and Cheese', which steps occurs after 'Mix pasta with sauce'?
Options:
- Bake with cheese topping
- Cook pasta less than directions
- Drizzle oil, garnish, serve
Right Explanation: To determine which step occurs after 'Mix pasta with sauce', let's consider the sequence of steps in a typical mac and cheese recipe:

Options:
- Cook pasta until al dente
- Crumble gingersnaps, whisk
- Bake until done
- Add shrimp and tomatoes
Right Explanation: To determine the correct step that occurs after 'Saute shallots and garlic', let's consider the logical sequence of a typical recipe involving shrimp and pasta in a basil cream sauce:

1. Typically, the early steps in a recipe involve preparing the base flavors, such as sautéing aromatics like shallots and garlic.
2. After the aromatics are sautéed, a common next step would be to add the main protein and vegetables, in this case, shrimp and tomatoes, to build on the flavor base.
3. Cooking pasta until al dente would usually occur separately or simultaneously but is not directly after sautéing shallots and garlic.
4. Crumbling gingersnaps and whisking does not fit the context of this dish and seems unrelated.
