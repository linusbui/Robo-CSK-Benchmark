The step in question is 'Arrange cheese on tomatoes', which implies that the cheese and tomatoes are being prepared or have been prepared to be placed together.

Given the options provided:
- Mix vinegar, mustard, salt: This step is likely part of making the balsamic vinaigrette, which would be used as a dressing.
- Sprinkle cheese, broil tomatoes: This option directly involves the cheese and tomatoes, suggesting it could be closely related to the step of arranging cheese on tomatoes.
- Combine pasta with cream, trout: This option seems unrelated to the main components of the Fresh Mozzarella & Tomato Salad, as it mentions pasta and trout, which are not indicated in the recipe title.
- Drizzle dressing over salad: This would logically occur after the salad components, including the cheese and tomatoes, have been arranged.
- Return to oven, stir: This option implies a cooking step that might not directly relate to the arrangement of cheese on tomatoes in a salad.

Considering the logical progression of preparing a salad, the step that would most likely occur before 'Arrange cheese on tomatoes' is the preparation of the components involved.

Options:
- Bake until firm

- Combine salad ingredients

- Pour mixture over popcorn","To determine the correct sequence of steps in the given recipe, 'Frisee and Watercress Salad with Jicama and Oranges', we need to analyze the nature of each step in relation to preparing a salad. The step in question, 'Whisk vinaigrette ingredients', implies the preparation of a dressing, which is typically done before it's applied to the salad ingredients.

Considering the options provided:
- 'Bake until firm' seems unrelated to the preparation of a salad.
- 'Serve over ice' could be a step in serving the salad but doesn't directly relate to the preparation of the vinaigrette.
- 'Combine salad ingredients' would logically happen after the vinaigrette is prepared, as the dressing is usually added to the combined ingredients.
- 'Prepare orange sections' could be a step that happens before whisking the vinaigrette ingredients, as it involves preparing one of the salad's components.
- 'Pour mixture over popcorn' is unrelated to the salad recipe provided.

Given the context, preparing components of the salad, such as the oranges, would logically occur before whisking the vinaigrette ingredients, as all components, including the dressing, need to be ready before they are combined.

This involves considering the typical preparation and assembly process of a sandwich, as well as the specific ingredients and cooking methods mentioned.

The step 'Layer onion, ham, apple, cheese' implies that the ingredients are being assembled or arranged on the sandwich. Therefore, any step that involves preparing or cooking these ingredients, or preparing the base for these ingredients (such as the bread), would occur before this layering step.

Considering the options provided:
- 'Add avocado pieces' could be a step that occurs after layering the main ingredients, as avocado is not mentioned in the recipe title and might be an additional topping.
- 'Drizzle with syrup' seems out of place in the context of a savory sandwich and might be more relevant as a final step or for a different recipe component.
- 'Brush bread with Dijon Glaze' is a step that would prepare the bread, which is a foundational component of the sandwich, making it a likely candidate to occur before the layering of the main ingredients.
- 'Grill steak to desired doneness' is irrelevant to the recipe title, which mentions ham, not steak.
- 'Grill until golden brown' could refer to grilling the sandwich itself after it has been assembled, which would occur after the layering step.

The step in question, 'Combine orange, beets, apples', suggests a point in the recipe where the main ingredients are being brought together. 

Given the options provided:
- Pour into greased pan: This action is more commonly associated with cooking methods like baking or frying and doesn't directly relate to the preparation of a salad.
- Boil and peel beets: This step is a preparatory action for beets, which are a key ingredient in the salad. Beets often need to be cooked before they can be peeled and used in salads.
- Stir in half-and-half: This action seems out of place in the context of the provided recipe title, as 'Beet, Orange and Apple Salad' does not typically include dairy products like half-and-half.
