"In the recipe 'Worlds Best Mac and Cheese', which step occurs before 'Mix pasta with sauce'?

Options:
- Spoon into crust
- Drizzle oil, garnish, serve
- Cook pasta less than directions
- Bake until cheese melts
- Bake with cheese topping","To determine which step occurs before ""Mix pasta with sauce"" in the recipe 'Worlds Best Mac and Cheese', let's consider the logical sequence of making mac and cheese:

1. **Cook pasta less than directions**: This step involves preparing the pasta before it is mixed with the sauce. It makes sense that pasta needs to be cooked before it can be mixed with any sauce.

2. **Mix pasta with sauce**: This is the step in question, where the cooked pasta is combined with the prepared cheese sauce.

3. **Spoon into crust**: This step likely comes after mixing the pasta with the sauce, assuming the mac and cheese are being placed into a crust for baking.

4. **Bake with cheese topping**: This step would logically follow after the pasta and sauce mixture has been placed into a baking dish or crust.

5. **Bake until cheese melts**: This is a continuation of the baking process.

6. **Drizzle oil, garnish, serve**: This is typically a finishing step after baking.

Given this logical flow, the step ""Cook pasta less than directions"" must occur before ""Mix pasta with sauce"" because the pasta needs to be prepared before it can be mixed.

Final answer: Cook pasta less than directions",Cook pasta less than directions,"To determine which step occurs before ""Mix pasta with sauce,"" we need to consider the logical order of preparing macaroni and cheese:

1. ""Cook pasta less than directions"" is likely the first step, as pasta needs to be cooked before it can be mixed with any sauce.
2. ""Mix pasta with sauce"" would logically follow the cooking of the pasta, as the pasta needs to be combined with the cheese sauce to create the dish.

The other options provided (spooning into crust, drizzling oil, baking, etc.) relate to steps that would occur after the pasta is mixed with the sauce, such as baking or serving the dish.

Therefore, the step that occurs before ""Mix pasta with sauce"" is:

Options:
- Cook on low or high
- Cook pasta until al dente
- Add shrimp and tomatoes
- Bake until done
- Crumble gingersnaps, whisk","To determine the correct step that occurs before 'Saute shallots and garlic', let's analyze each option:

1. **Cook on low or high**: This step is too vague and doesn't provide enough context to be directly related to the preparation of a basil cream sauce or its components.

2. **Cook pasta until al dente**: Cooking pasta is a common preliminary step in pasta dishes, as it needs to be prepared before combining it with other ingredients. This step is likely to occur before sautéing shallots and garlic, which are typically part of the sauce preparation.

3. **Add shrimp and tomatoes**: This step likely occurs after sautéing shallots and garlic, as these ingredients are usually added to the sautéed base to create the sauce.

4. **Bake until done**: Baking is not a typical step in preparing a shrimp and pasta dish with a basil cream sauce, suggesting this step is unrelated or occurs much later, if at all.

5. **Crumble gingersnaps, whisk**: This step seems unrelated to the recipe, as gingersnaps are not typically involved in a basil cream sauce for pasta.

"In the recipe 'Smoked Fish & Broccoli Flan', which step occurs before 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish'?

Options:
- Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese
- Bake until done
- Add shrimp and tomatoes
- Roll out dough, line dish
- Crumble gingersnaps, whisk","To determine the correct step that occurs before 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish', let's consider the logical sequence of preparing a flan:

1. **Crumble gingersnaps, whisk** - This step seems unrelated to the main flan preparation, as it involves gingersnaps, which are not typically associated with a fish and broccoli flan. It might be a step for a different recipe or a topping, but it doesn't logically precede arranging the main ingredients.

2. **Roll out dough, line dish** - This step is likely to occur early in the process, as lining the dish with dough is a foundational step before adding any fillings or mixtures. It makes sense to prepare the base before arranging the ingredients.

3. **Add shrimp and tomatoes** - This step involves adding additional ingredients to the flan, which would typically happen after arranging the main ingredients like broccoli, onion, and fish.

4. **Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese** - This is a step that would logically follow arranging the ingredients, as you would pour the custard mixture over the arranged items and then sprinkle cheese before baking.

5. **Bake until done** - This is the final cooking step and would logically occur after all ingredients are arranged and the mixture is poured.

Considering these steps, the most logical step that occurs before 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish' is 'Roll out dough, line dish', as you need to have the base prepared before arranging the ingredients on it.

Final answer: Roll out dough, line dish","Roll out dough, line dish","To determine the correct step that occurs before 'Arrange broccoli, onion, fish', let's consider the logical sequence of preparing a flan.

1. **Roll out dough, line dish**: This step involves preparing the base of the flan. It is likely to occur early in the process to have the dish ready for filling.

2. **Arrange broccoli, onion, fish**: This involves placing the ingredients into the prepared dish. Therefore, the step that prepares the dish should logically come before this.

3. **Add shrimp and tomatoes**: This might be an additional filling step, possibly occurring after arranging the broccoli, onion, and fish.

4. **Pour mixture, sprinkle cheese**: This is likely to happen after arranging all solid ingredients in the dish.

5. **Bake until done**: This is a final cooking step after all ingredients are arranged and prepared.

"In the recipe 'Simple Rack of Lamb', which step occurs before 'Sprinkle with spices, oil'?

Options:
- Steam until lobster is opaque
