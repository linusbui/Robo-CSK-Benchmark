"Task: add a fourth tile to the word
Configurations: The robot has 1 arm(s) with 1 DoFs and rigid No specified Gripper and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 7 DoFs and rigid Robot Grippers with 2 Fingers and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 6 DoFs and rigid Robot Grippers with 2 Fingers and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 6 DoFs and rigid No specified Gripper and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 5 DoFs and rigid No specified Gripper and it can not walk.
Principles:","1. Degrees of Freedom (DoFs): Understanding the significance of the number of DoFs in robotic arms, which affects their range of motion and capability to perform tasks.

2. Gripper Type: Recognizing the impact of different gripper types (rigid, flexible, specified, or unspecified) on the robot's ability to manipulate objects.

3. Arm Configuration: Analyzing how the configuration of the robot's arm (number of arms and their arrangement) influences its operational efficiency and task execution.

4. Mobility Constraints: Considering the implications of the robot's inability to walk, which limits its operational environment and the types of tasks it can perform.

5. Task Complexity: Evaluating how the combination of arm capabilities, gripper types, and mobility affects the complexity of the task at hand, such as adding a tile to a word.","Task: add a fourth tile to the word
