"Task: add a fourth tile to the word
Configurations: The robot has 1 arm(s) with 6 DoFs and rigid Robot Grippers with 2 Fingers and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 1 DoFs and rigid No specified Gripper and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 5 DoFs and rigid No specified Gripper and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 7 DoFs and rigid Robot Grippers with 2 Fingers and it can not walk., The robot has 1 arm(s) with 6 DoFs and rigid No specified Gripper and it can not walk.
Your answer:
The most suitable hardware configuration for the task of adding a fourth tile to the word is: **The robot has 1 arm(s) with 7 DoFs and rigid Robot Grippers with 2 Fingers and it can not walk.**

This configuration is optimal because the 7 degrees of freedom (DoFs) allow for greater flexibility and precision in positioning the arm to manipulate the tiles effectively. The rigid robot grippers with 2 fingers provide a reliable means to grasp and place the tiles accurately.

Your Feedback:
Your answer effectively identifies the most suitable hardware configuration for the task of adding a fourth tile to the word. You correctly emphasize the importance of having 7 degrees of freedom (DoFs) for flexibility and precision, which is crucial for tasks that require careful manipulation. Additionally, the mention of rigid robot grippers with 2 fingers is relevant, as it highlights the robot's ability to grasp and place tiles accurately.

However, it would be beneficial to briefly explain why the other configurations are less suitable. For instance, configurations with fewer DoFs may limit the robot's ability to maneuver in tight spaces or achieve the necessary angles for precise placement. This additional context would strengthen your argument.

Overall, your answer is clear and well-reasoned, making a strong case for the chosen configuration.
