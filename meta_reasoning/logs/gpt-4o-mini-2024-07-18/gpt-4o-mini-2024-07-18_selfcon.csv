     - Cons: Lack of a gripper means it cannot grasp the sofa directly.
   
   - **Configuration 2**: 0 arms with 4 DoFs, rigid No specified Gripper, cannot walk.
     - Not suitable as it has no arms for manipulation.
   
   - **Configuration 3**: 1 arm with 1 DoF, rigid No specified Gripper, cannot walk.
     - Limited capability due to only 1 DoF, making it difficult to maneuver the sofa.
   
   - **Configuration 4**: 0 arms with 5 DoFs, rigid No specified Gripper, cannot walk.
     - Not suitable as it has no arms for manipulation.
   
   - **Configuration 5**: 0 arms with 6 DoFs, rigid No specified Gripper, cannot walk.
     - Not suitable as it has no arms for manipulation.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The only configuration that has an arm and sufficient DoFs to potentially manipulate an object is **Configuration 1**. Although it lacks a gripper, the 6 DoFs would provide the necessary flexibility to maneuver around the sofa, provided an alternative method of securing or moving the sofa can be implemented (for example, using suction or a different attachment).

1. **Number of Arms**: Since the task involves manipulation of cups, having at least one arm would be beneficial for grasping and moving the cups.

2. **Degrees of Freedom (DoFs)**: More DoFs allow for greater flexibility and dexterity in movement. This is important for accurately positioning and arranging the cups.

3. **Gripper Type**: A rigid gripper with fingers is more suitable for grasping objects like cups compared to a configuration without a specified gripper.

4. **Mobility**: While all configurations indicate the robot cannot walk, this does not impact the ability to arrange cups as long as the robot can reach the cups and manipulate them effectively.

Now, let's analyze the configurations:

1. **0 arms with 6 DoFs and rigid grippers**: No arms means no ability to manipulate cups.
   
2. **1 arm with 7 DoFs and rigid grippers**: This configuration allows for high flexibility and dexterity, making it ideal for arranging cups.

1. **Understanding the Task**: The task is to arrange cups. This involves picking up cups, possibly repositioning them, and placing them in a specific order or location. Key requirements include the ability to grasp, lift, and move the cups.

2. **Arm Configuration**: 
   - The configurations with ""0 arm(s)"" are not suitable because they lack the necessary mobility to pick up and arrange cups.
   - The configurations with ""1 arm(s)"" are more promising as they have the potential to manipulate objects.

3. **Degrees of Freedom (DoFs)**:
   - The configurations with higher DoFs (7 DoFs and 6 DoFs) will provide greater flexibility and dexterity in movement. This is important for accurately grasping and positioning cups, which can vary in size and shape.
   - The configuration with ""1 arm(s) and 1 DoFs"" is too limited for the task, as it would not allow for the necessary range of motion.

4. **Gripper Type**:
   - The configurations with ""rigid Robot Grippers with 2 Fingers"" are preferable because they can effectively grasp cups. A two-finger gripper is capable of securely holding cylindrical objects like cups.
   - The configurations with ""rigid No specified Gripper"" lack the necessary mechanism to grasp objects, making them unsuitable for the task.
