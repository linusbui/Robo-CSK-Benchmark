2. Make a preliminary identification of the plates used to eat the meal with: For nachos, which are typically served as a shared dish or a casual meal, a Dinner Plate or a Coupe Plate could be suitable. A Dinner Plate is standard for main courses, while a Coupe Plate, with its slightly raised edges, can help contain the toppings and prevent spillage.

Its raised edges help contain the toppings and prevent them from spilling over, making it more suitable for this type of meal.
