Both forks and knives typically have handles designed to provide a secure grip, but this principle reinforces the importance of traditional utensils over alternatives like hands or tongs.

4. **Tine size and spacing**: The tines of the fork should be spaced widely enough to accommodate the thickness of the noodles and eggplant slices. Standard dinner forks usually have tines that are appropriately spaced for this purpose, making them suitable for eating baked noodles and eggplant.

5. **Material durability**: The cutlery should be made of a durable material that can withstand the moderate heat and moisture of the baked dish. Materials like stainless steel or silverware are ideal for this purpose.

Considering these principles, the most appropriate cutlery for eating Baked Noodles and Eggplant would include a **Fork** as the primary utensil, potentially assisted by a **Knife** for cutting larger pieces into manageable sizes.

3. **Scooping action**: The curved shape of a fork allows for easy scooping and lifting of the mash potatoes, which is ideal for this type of food. This further supports the use of a fork.

4. **Minimal piercing**: The fork's tines should be used to gently pierce and lift the mash potatoes, rather than stabbing or piercing aggressively. This principle also aligns with using a fork.

5. **No knife required**: Since mash potatoes are soft and easy to eat, a knife is not necessary for cutting or tearing the food. This means we can stick with just a fork.

Based on these principles, the chosen cutlery for eating mash potatoes is: Fork",[<Utensil.FORK: 'Fork'>],"[<Utensil.FORK: 'Fork'>, <Utensil.SPOON: 'Spoon'>]"
